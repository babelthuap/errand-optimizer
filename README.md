# Errand Optimizer

_by Nicholas Neumann-Chun_

This is a little app that allows users to input several addresses, then find the fastest way to visit them all starting from and returning to their current location.  It uses a straightforward brute-force solution to the [travelling salesman problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem).  This isn't a problem, becuase the bottleneck is actually the Google Maps query limit.
